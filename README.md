# TikTok-Crawler-python

This crawler can crawl video data under a certain topic. Including author's info and video's info. 

The max number of video it could crawl in one loop is 27, I set the loop time as 100. However, due to some problem in my algorithm(explained in design document), there will be repeat video. Therefore, it could crawl around 2000 videos at a time(after remove repeat video) and it cost less than 2 mins. 

PLEASE check the design document for more information.
